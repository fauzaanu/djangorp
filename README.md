## DRP

Django with Redis and Postgres. Redis as a cache and Postgres as a database.


### Tailwindcss
- The `jstoolchain` folder includes a tailwindcss setup
- You should run `npm i` to install the dependencies
- There is also a `.xml` file for PyCharm users to make it a `File Watcher`
- The `tailwind.config.js` file is configured to search for `html` and `py` files
- `py` files because forms.py could have tailwindcss classes due to the user of `crispy-forms` with `crispy-tailwind`

### Important / Best Practices
- Generate migrations from dev environment and commit them to the repo
